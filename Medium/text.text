The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.To be or not to be, that is the question.All that glitters is not gold.I think, therefore I am.In the end, we only regret the chances we didnâ€™t take.Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to it.The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today.Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success.The only way to do great work is to love what you do.The best way to predict the future is to invent it.The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.Hardships often prepare ordinary people for an extraordinary destiny.It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves.Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it.The only impossible journey is the one you never begin.Opportunities don't happen. You create them.Don't be afraid to give up the good to go for the great.I find that the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have.Success is not how high you have climbed, but how you make a positive difference to the world.The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.Success seems to be connected with action. Successful people keep moving.The purpose of our lives is to be happy.Get busy living or get busy dying.You have within you right now, everything you need to deal with whatever the world can throw at you.Believe you can and you're halfway there.The only way to achieve the impossible is to believe it is possible.Challenges are what make life interesting and overcoming them is what makes life meaningful.When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it.
